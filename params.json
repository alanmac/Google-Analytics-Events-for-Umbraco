Install the Umbraco-GA-Event-Tracking package\r\n2. Include the event tracking script via the Html Helper anywhere AFTER you have included Google Analytics in your master template page.\r\n\r\n### Including Google Analytics\r\n\r\nFor your convenience, we have a handy helper available for outputting the GA script. You do not have to use this method if you have already included GA but if you do, make sure to set your API key.\r\n\r\n> Set your API key in the properties of the Event Tracking content node\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n@Html.IncludeGoogleAnalytics()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Including the Tracking Script\r\n\r\nAs above, just add this bit of razor code anywhere after you include GA in your master template\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n@Html.IncludeGaEventTracking()\r\n```\r\n\r\n## How to Use\r\n\r\n### Coming soon\r\n\r\n## How do I Contribute?\r\n\r\nFirst off, please create an issue before coding away and putting in a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Getting the Demo Project Working\r\n\r\nThe actual umbraco package is contained in a separate project in the Visual Studio solution. \r\n\r\nBuilding this project will automatically copy over all necessary files to the Demo website project. You then can use this Demo to test with.\r\n\r\n#### Demo Login: \r\n\r\nUser: admin@test.com\r\nPassword: password123\r\n\r\n## Developers\r\n\r\nThis package is built and maintained by [Luke Warren](http://lukewarrendev.co.za) and [Paul Seal](http://www.codeshare.co.uk/).\r\n\r\nSpecial mention to:\r\n\r\n[Syncrony](http://syncrony.com)\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n## TODO ",
